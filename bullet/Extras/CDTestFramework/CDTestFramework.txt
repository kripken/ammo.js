CD Test Framework
=================

This is a very small app used to test various collision detection (CD) algorithms.
It will be first used as a demo/sample for Opcode 1.3 (a lot of people requested this),
and then I will also include benchmarks against competing libraries (Bullet, GIMPACT, etc).

Update April 2, 2008
Erwin Coumans added Bullet support for broadphase test (SAP, MultiSAP, other tests follow)
This CDTestFramework is now included in Bullet/Extras under the ZLib license.

Current version includes tests for:
- sphere vs mesh queries
- OBB vs mesh queries
- capsule vs mesh queries
- complete box pruning
- bipartite box pruning
