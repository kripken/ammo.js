FLUIDS v.1 - SPH Fluid Simulator for CPU and GPU
Copyright (C) 2008. Rama Hoetzlein, http://www.rchoetzlein.com

A fast CPU and GPU fluid simulator. See website above for details.

Notes 
(April 2009)
-------------------

- Press 'h' for help screen. This shows keyboard cmds available.

- By default, GPU simulation is off.
  When running the fluid_gpu.exe, press 'g' to start/stop GPU simulation.

- Disabling shadows in common_defs.h will greatly speed up the simulation
  (You can also press 's' to render without shadows)

- As of April 2009, CUDA builds only under Visual Studio 2005, not VS 2008.
  To enable the CUDA build in VS2005, set the BUILD_CUDA define in common_defs.h
  Be sure this is turned off if you build with VS2008.

- The GPU integrator is not yet complete. Integration always takes place on the CPU, in both CPU and GPU modes. (As a result, this forces a bus transfer to and from the GPU per cycle. Once the integrator is finished, GPU simulation performance should increase significantly.)

- Occassionally, the GPU simulation with crash cuda, causing the screen to blink and particles to move randomly. This is believed to be due to a not-yet-found out of bounds condition.
