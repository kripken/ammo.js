/// ThreadingDemo shows how to use the cross platform thread support interface.
/// You can start threads and perform a blocking wait for completion
/// Under Windows it uses Win32 Threads. On Mac and Linux it uses pthreads. On PlayStation 3 Cell SPU it uses SPURS.

/// June 2010 
/// New: critical section/barriers and non-blocking pollingn for completion, currently Windows only
